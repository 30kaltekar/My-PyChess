# Welcome to the Docs

This is the documentation for the PyChess game.

## main.py

- The main.py is the main file that manages the whole game. It uses pygame, to create the home interface.

### def pieceGen

- This is a function that generates the board in form of a list. This "board" is a list of lists that store piece name and its coordinates.

### def showMain

- This is a function that displays the menu

The True loop of the menu just checks which button has been pressed to call the respective functions.

Finally, if the mouse is hovered over the text it changes colour
