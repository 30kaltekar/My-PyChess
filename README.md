# My-PyChess
A Multiplayer Chess app written in Python using Pygame Library

# Welcome to PyChess!

This is a python app purely created from scratch using just Python(cpython version 3.7.3) and Pygame.

To run the game, download Pygame library and run the- main.py file.
You will see the chess board appear. Go ahead and enjoy the chess match with your friend.

Under just 500 lines of code, this is very light and efficient..

If you take a look at the source code, You can observe that Object Oriented Programming style has not been used. Instead, a Functional Programming approach has been taken. This means that the code is slightly complicated, but will work well.

To explain in short- how the logic works in the chess game,
- Pygame provides th tools for GUI and mouse handling
- There are 2 lists that hold the position of each piece
- The functions are written, each with a specific use to handle data and play chess
- this encorporates almost all the features of chess(except en-passant)
- Also(as of 27 oct 2019) This cannot detect checkmate or stalemate.
- More updates coming soon
- Feel free to download the code, use it and please notify me if you come across bugs and glitches.
