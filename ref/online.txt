                        Online Gameplay
                        ---------------
===============================================================
Online Gameplay consists of two elements, client and server.

CLIENT: It is the machine that runs My-PyChess code.
SERVER: It is a machine that accepts connections from different clients(upto 10)

HOW TO HOST SERVER:
==================
Run server.py code on any machine, as simple as that!
    
HOW TO MANAGE THE SERVER:
========================
    
When the server is running, it is constantly messaging you whatever is going
on. You can enter commands to the server.

Commands are listed below
=========================
1) report
    Gives the current status of the server with useful information like the
    number of threads the server is running, number of people online etc etc
    
2) mypublicip
    Enter this command to know your public IP
    
3) lock
    This will put the server in a "locked" state. After this, anyone will not
    be able to connect to the server. This will not affect anyone who is
    aldready connected to the server.
    
4) unlock
    This will "unlock" the server, the server that is locked will be "unlocked",
    then anybody can connect to the server. This is the default state of the
    server, when it has started to run.
    
    
3) kickall
    Kick EVERYONE connected to the server.
    
4) kick <id>
    Kick a particular player (whose id is <id>)
    example: 'kick 3294'
    
5) quit
    Enter this to stop the server and quit.
    
IF YOU WANT TO CLOSE THE SERVER WHILE IT IS RUNNING, ENTER "quit" IN SHELL.
TRYING TO FORCE CLOSE THE SERVER MAY GIVE UNEXPECTED RESULTS TO CLIENTS
CONNECTED.
    
WHAT IS AN ID, WHAT IS A KEY?
=============================
When the clients connect to server (using TCP protocol with sockets),
server issues the client a unique 4-digit number as their 'ID' or 'key'.


I WANT TO PLAY REAL ONLINE CHESS. HOW MUST I HOST THE SERVER?
=============================================================
Everything is dependent on the reach of the server, to whom the server
is visible.

There are 3 cases that determine the servers reach -

1) The host machine is not connected to a router:
    In that case, any machine CANNOT CONNECT to server other than itself.
    This means that only the client running on the same machine can connect
    to the server (That's pointless)

2) The host machine is connected to a router:
    In that case, any machine connected to the SAME ROUTER can connect to
    server.

3) The host machine is connected to a router with port forwarding enabled:
    In this case, ANY machine in the world that is simply connected to the
    internet can be a client. The server just has to enable port forwarding.
    It is to be noted that the client need not do anything special like port
    forwarding. All clients will connect to the server via its public IP
    address. To learn more, go through helpful resources available online.
    
The third option is what you must do.


SECURITY WARNING
================
Sharing the public IP address of your home network with anyone puts it at a
risk of being attacked by hackers around the globe.
